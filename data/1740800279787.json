Identify Assets: What are the system’s valuable components? assets could be user's personal identifiable data like credit card numbers, SSN, or sensitive company information.\n\n2. Create an Architecture Overview: This involves understanding and mapping out the data flow and identify trust boundaries.\n\n3. Decompose the Application: Involves breaking down the application system into its core components (e.g., servers, firewalls, target hosts, data flows) so you can think more precisely about vulnerability points and attack vectors.\n\n4. Identify Threats: This step involves identifying the potential threats to the system.\n\n5. Document Threats: The identified threats are documented and then ranked according to severity.\n\n6. Address Each Threat: Each threat must be addressed – this could involve mitigating the threat, transferring the risk, accepting the risks, or even changing the project scope.\n\n7. Validate, Monitor and Update: Ongoing process to validate defenses are working, continuous monitoring of threats and updating the threat models with new threats.\n\nThreat modeling helps bring security awareness to application projects, helping to prioritize how potential threats should be handled, and provide a cost-effective way to enhance the security of an application or a project.",
